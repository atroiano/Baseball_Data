# Baseball_Data
These files contain the code I used to create a Shiny Server to plot batted ball baseball data and do some basic clustering with K-Means.

Right now, the server is set up to pull the data in and defaul to my man, Bryce Harper.  Over the next month or two, I will be creating a public facing server for you all to see it in action.  Until then, feel free to use the code I have here and add other data to it.
